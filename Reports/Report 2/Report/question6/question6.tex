Based on the investigation detailed throughout the report, these are the recommendations that I could make:

\begin{myenum}
    \item Investigate the LinkedIn account of Michael Harris, especially regarding signs of communication with the account "John Davis".
    \item Investigate the phone calls made by Michael Harris using known and accessible mobile devices at around Sep 4, 2020, 16:35 AEST.
    \item Investigate any surveillance system available within the premises of Caelus Engineering to verify the whereabouts of Alyx Hamilton's laptop from Sep 4, 14:05 ACST to Sep 4, 15:20 ACST.
