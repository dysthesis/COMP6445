The exit time of Alyx Hamilton (16:58) corroborates David Caelus' account that her laptop did not leave the Caelus Engineering's network until after 5pm.

However, this does not necessarily imply that Alyx brought her laptop with her when she left the premises; another possible scenario is for her to have left the premises without her laptop, and the device being disconnected from the network around the same time (whether intentionally by a person or otherwise). If the latter were the case and it was caused by someone's deliberate actions, it may indicate an intent to frame Alyx for the disappearance and disposal of the laptop. That person would need to be within proximity of Alyx during the time of her exit to both be informed of her exit and promptly access her laptop.
