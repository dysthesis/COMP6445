# CCTV photo

The image is of an electronic gate, which appears to be similar to what can be commonly found in corporate buildings.

It may be reasonable to infer that the function of this gate is to control access to a section of the building, usually by means of electronic ID cards distributed to relevant persons.

## Height

Comparing it to the person standing some distance away behind the gate, the gate appears to be around the height of the average person, rendering the possibility of bypassing the gate by manoeuvring over it unlikely.
